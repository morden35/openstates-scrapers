# Overview - Open States People Scrapers

The goal of the openstates-scrapers/scrapers_next/il/people.py script is to scrape information on Senators and Representatives for the state of Illinois. This information is scraped from the following 'list' web pages:
https://ilga.gov/senate/default.asp?GA=102
https://ilga.gov/house/default.asp?GA=102

In addition to scraping information from House and Senate 'list' web pages, this script scrapes additional information from each 'detail' web page for each Senator and Representative. An example 'detail' page can be found here: https://ilga.gov/senate/Senator.asp?GA=102&MemberID=2886.
